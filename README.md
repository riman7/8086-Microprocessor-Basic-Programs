# 8086 Microprocessor Basic Programs

This repository contains basic assembly language programs for the 8086 microprocessor. These programs cover various fundamental operations and problem-solving techniques useful for learning and understanding 8086 assembly programming.

## üìÇ List of Programs  
These are the solved problems of the 8086 microprocessor asked in the IOE examination.

| 12 | WAP in 8086 to read string from user and  display only alphabetic characters from the string in clear screen.| [click_here](print_only_alphabet.asm) |  
| 13 | WAP in 8086 which will input the username from the keyboard. If the user is "Tribhuvan University" it will display "valid user" else it will display "invalid user".| [click_here](valid_user.asm) |  
| 14 | WAP in 8086 to input a string, count the word of this string whose length is greater than 5 and display this count in clear screen.| [click_here](word_with_len_5.asm) |

## Basic Templetes
This is the basic templete that almost every 8086 microprocessor program must have.
```assembly
.model small	; Defines the memory model. "small" means code and data fit within 64KB each.
.stack 64	; Allocates a 64-byte stack for the program. 
.data		; Section for declaring variables (if needed).

.code		;code section
    main proc far 
        
        MOV ax, @data
        MOV ds, ax	; Initializes the data segment (only needed if data section exists).

        ;your code here...
     
        mov ax, 4C00h	; DOS interrupt to return control to the OS.
        int 21h    
    main endp
 end
```

### Loop

```Assembly

MOV CX, 0
MOV CL, 05h  ;no of times loop runs 
L1:
 
     ;code here...
     INC SI  ;only if SI is used in loop(used in most cases)

LOOP L1
            
```

### New Line
```Assembly
MOV AH, 02H        ; SELECT DOS FUNCTION 02H (DISPLAY CHARACTER)
MOV DL, 0AH        ; ASCII CODE FOR LINE FEED.
INT 21H            ; CALL DOS INTERRUPT TO PRINT THE CHARACTER

MOV DL, 0DH        ; ASCII CODE FOR CARRIAGE RETURN (CR - MOVE TO BEGINNING OF LINE)
INT 21H            ; CALL DOS INTERRUPT TO PRINT THE CHARACTER    
```

### String
```Assembly
.DATA  
    MAXLEN DB 255         ; MAXIMUM BUFFER SIZE (255 CHARACTERS)  
    ACTLEN DB ?           ; ACTUAL LENGTH OF INPUT (FILLED AFTER INPUT)  
    INPUT DB 255 DUP('$') ; BUFFER TO STORE USER INPUT

    MSG DB 'ENTER A STRING: $' ; PROMPT MESSAGE
.CODE  
    MAIN PROC FAR  
        ; INITIALIZE DATA SEGMENT  
        MOV AX, @DATA  
        MOV DS, AX  

        ; DISPLAY MESSAGE "ENTER A STRING: "  
        LEA DX, MSG          ; Store address of MSG in DX
        MOV AH, 09H          ; DOS FUNCTION 09H (PRINT STRING)  
        INT 21H  

        ; READ STRING FROM USER  
        LEA DX, MAXLEN        ; SET BUFFER LOCATION  
        MOV AH, 0AH           ; DOS FUNCTION 0AH (BUFFERED INPUT)  
        INT 21H

         ; DISPLAY ENTERED STRING  
        LEA DX, INPUT         ; SKIP FIRST TWO BYTES (MAXLEN & ACTLEN)  
        MOV AH, 09H           ; DOS FUNCTION 09H (PRINT STRING)  
        INT 21H  

```

### Clear Screeen
```Assembly
.code
    main proc far 
        
        ;clear screen
        MOV AX,0600H;REQ TO SCROLL
    	MOV BH,61H        ;BLUE ON BROWN FOR ATTRIBUT ON PIXEL 
    	MOV CX,0000H
    	MOV DX,1950H
    	INT 10h
    	;Cursor Reset
    	MOV AH, 02h      ; Function 02h: Set cursor position
    	MOV BH, 00h      ; Video page 0
    	MOV DX, 0000h    ; Row 0, column 0
        INT 10h

     main endp
 end
```

### Index  
- Other than SI, BX and DI can also be used as index.
